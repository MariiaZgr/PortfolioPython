# PortfolioPython

## What is this Repository?
This repository contains my `Python` - related hobby, and education projects.

Most of these projects have been fuilfilled during education on Python Programmer, and include mostly backend implemnentations, some DevOps, and automations.

Each Project resides within it's own subfolder, and have it's own `readme.md`, with details about each specific Project.

# Projects descriptions

## [api_yamdb](https://github.com/MariiaZgr/PortfolioPython/tree/main/api_yamdb)

### Description
This is a simple project, where I have been responsible for developing DevOps support for the existing Django-based solution.

As a part of this Project I have been responsible for developing CI/CD automation.

Also here we have been configuring our own Cloud-based container (Yandex-cloud, Linux-based, accessible via SSH virtualized machine), which was our `target` environment.

This Project was one of the latest Projects I have worked with during my education on Python Developer.

### Lessons learned
* How to work with docker repostories
* How to design and create docker images
* How to prepare and push docker containers
* How docker compose setup works
* How to work with Cloud-based containers via SSH
* How to build CI/CD automations, using GitHub Workflows features
* How to create pipeline status alerts for messengers, specifically Telegram
* How to use SSH and work with remote resources

### Tech stack
* PostgreSQL (RDB, SQL)
* Python (Django, pure Python)
* Docker (docker, docker compose)
* Cloud-based resources
* GitHub Workflow (CI/CD)

## [api_yatube](https://github.com/MariiaZgr/PortfolioPython/tree/main/api_yatube)
### Description

In this project I was mostly responsible for developing `REST API` for existing frontend solution, and developing proper test coverage for the functionality that I add.

Also this project helped me to understand the concept of `Migrations` for persistence layer, and how to manage them, using `Django` framework.

### Lessons learned
* How to work with technical requirements
* Introduction to Swagger
* How to develop tests for functionality that I add
* How to develop and maintain tests suite for the Solution
* How to make minor adjustments on Frontend implementation
* Sustain Data layer integrity between versions of API (value of ORM and Migrations)
* How to work with `env` concept (Environment configurations)
* Introduction to Authorizations mechanisms, and API Authorization Guards for specific endpoints

### Tech stack
* Python (Django, Django REST Framework)
* Unit Tests (Unittest, Pytest)
* OAuth2 (JWT)

## [foodgram_project_react](https://github.com/MariiaZgr/PortfolioPython/tree/main/foodgram_project_react)
### Description
This was my first experience with the Full-stack development of the applications, and also - my final "graduation" project for my Python Developer education.

One of the most important things learned here was `Web Server` role in the Web Application's life, how to configure it, and what is is responsible for.

I have not been that much involved in Frontend development, as it was mainly done using React, but I have been tweaking some specific views, as per requirements, using HTML/CSS/JS languages.

Basically - everything I have learned in previous projects have been used here.

### Lessons learned
* How to spin up whole Solution locally, working with some services as a "black box"
    * including RDB (SQLite) service
    * and Frontend (NodeJS) service
* How to refine requirements

### Tech stack
* Python (Django, Django REST Framework)
* Unit Tests (Unittest, Pytest)
* PostgreSQL (RDB, SQL)
* Frontend development (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Docker (docker, docker compose)
* Cloud-based resources
* GitHub Workflow (CI/CD)

## [telegram_bot](https://github.com/MariiaZgr/PortfolioPython/tree/main/telegram_bot)
### Description
This is a simple project where I have been responsible for developing simple Messaging Bot, with integration to External API.

Bot is polling external API's endpoint, gets response, and when needed - composes message to specific Telegram Chat.

### Lessons learned
* Integration to external API
* Messaging robot design and implementation

### Tech stack
* Python
* REST API
